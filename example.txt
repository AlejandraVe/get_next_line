One hundred and one steps,
Round and down,
New Year's Eve, one night in the town,


Can change one life into eternity.
I was born and raised by the sea,
shy yet proud,
learned to stay away from the crowd,
in my home, my lighthouse.
One hundred and one steps,
Round and down,
New Year's Eve, one night in the town,
Can change one life into eternity.
